# Challenge 2
In this challenge we expanded the capabilities of the original AllStocks Analysis subroutine. After refactoring our original code, the new version should be better equipped to handle multiple stocks analysis in an orgnaized manner aided by the added arrays. 
'tickerIndex' tracker should also function as a directory counter, making it easy for the user to track progress.
